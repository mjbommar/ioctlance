## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Windows Driver Vulnerability Scanner

IOCTLance is an advanced security tool for detecting vulnerabilities in Windows Driver Model (WDM) drivers using
symbolic execution and taint analysis. Originally presented at [CODE BLUE 2023](https://codeblue.jp/2023/en/), this *
*completely refactored version** represents a ground-up rewrite of the original IOCTLance project with modern Python
architecture, improved performance, and comprehensive vulnerability detection capabilities.

**Note**: This fork is a complete rewrite/refactor of the original IOCTLance research inspired
by [this vxunderground tweet](https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1956385645095796889) and my own stubborn stupidity.

The goal in Phase 1 is to set the project up for PyO3/Maturin integration to allow for faster symbolic execution
and taint analysis using Rust. This will significantly improve performance and allow for more complex analysis
capabilities in the future.

The architecture, testing methodology, and implementation have been redesigned from scratch while preserving and
extending on the core vulnerability detection logic. But it's still based on the original research and findings of the
IOCTLance project and therefore I preserved the license and name (though maybe name should be changed to avoid
confusion?).



## üéØ Detected Vulnerability Types

- **Memory Exploitation**
    - Physical memory mapping (MmMapIoSpace)
    - Buffer overflow & stack corruption (with RCE detection)
    - Use-after-free & double-free
    - Null pointer dereference
    - **Arbitrary read/write via controllable memcpy** (src/dst address control)

- **Access Control & Privilege Escalation**
    - **ObOpenObjectByPointer abuse** (kernel privilege escalation)
    - Controllable process handles & termination
    - Arbitrary read/write operations
    - ProbeForRead/Write bypass
    - Token stealing primitives

- **Code Execution**
    - Buffer overflow with controllable PC (RCE)
    - Arbitrary shellcode execution
    - Dangerous MSR operations (wrmsr)
    - Arbitrary I/O port access

- **Race Conditions**
    - Double-fetch vulnerabilities
    - TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use)

## üîÑ Recent Improvements (Refactored Version)

This repository contains a significantly refactored version of IOCTLance with **full parity** with the original implementation plus substantial enhancements:

### Complete Feature Parity + Enhancements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync

# Or use Docker (CLI version)
docker build -f Dockerfile.cli -t ioctlance-cli .
docker run -v $(pwd)/samples:/samples ioctlance-cli /samples/driver.sys
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze a single driver (local)
uv run python -m ioctlance.cli samples/RtDashPt.sys

# Analyze with Docker (mount samples directory and analyze a driver)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/samples:/samples ioctlance-cli /samples/RtDashPt.sys

# Analyze with specific timeout
uv run python -m ioctlance.cli --timeout 60 samples/RtDashPt.sys

# Target specific IOCTL code
uv run python -m ioctlance.cli --ioctl 0x22201c samples/RtDashPt.sys

# Analyze directory of drivers
uv run python -m ioctlance.cli samples/

# Output results to JSON
uv run python -m ioctlance.cli --output results.json samples/RtDashPt.sys

### Benefits of Enhanced Output

1. **Reproducibility**: Complete constraints and concrete inputs allow reproducing vulnerabilities
2. **Debugging**: Execution trace and instruction context help understand vulnerability paths
3. **Severity Assessment**: Additional context enables better vulnerability prioritization
4. **Integration**: Structured data with timestamps facilitates integration with other tools
5. **Forensics**: Raw state data preserves complete vulnerability context for analysis

## üåê REST API (Optional)

IOCTLance includes an optional high-performance REST API built with FastAPI for programmatic access and integration with other tools. The API supports asynchronous processing, batch analysis, and real-time WebSocket notifications.

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Using docker-compose (recommended)
docker compose up -d

# Or using docker run
docker build -f Dockerfile.api -t ioctlance-api .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/samples:/app/samples:ro ioctlance-api

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | API info and version |
| `/health` | GET | Health check with stats |
| `/docs` | GET | Interactive API documentation |
| `/upload` | POST | Upload driver for analysis |
| `/analyze/{file_hash}` | POST | Start analysis of uploaded driver |
| `/status/{job_id}` | GET | Check analysis job status |
| `/result/{job_id}` | GET | Get analysis results |
| `/batch` | POST | Analyze multiple drivers |
| `/jobs` | GET | List all analysis jobs |
| `/ws/{job_id}` | WS | WebSocket for real-time updates |

### Example: Upload and Analyze Driver

```bash
# 1. Upload driver
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/upload \
  -F "file=@samples/RtDashPt.sys")
FILE_HASH=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.file_hash')

# 2. Start analysis
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/analyze/${FILE_HASH}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"timeout": 120}')
JOB_ID=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.job_id')

# 3. Get results when complete
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/result/${JOB_ID}" | jq
```

### Python Client Example

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def analyze_driver(driver_path: str):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080") as client:
        # Upload driver
        with open(driver_path, "rb") as f:
            response = await client.post("/upload", files={"file": f})
            file_hash = response.json()["file_hash"]
        
        # Start analysis
        response = await client.post(
            f"/analyze/{file_hash}",
            json={"timeout": 120}
        )
        job_id = response.json()["job_id"]
        
        # Poll for completion
        while True:
            status = await client.get(f"/status/{job_id}")
            status_data = status.json()
            
            if status_data["status"] == "completed":
                result = await client.get(f"/result/{job_id}")
                result_data = result.json()
                print(f"Found {len(result_data['vuln'])} vulnerabilities")
                return result_data
            elif status_data["status"] == "failed":
                print(f"Analysis failed: {status_data.get('error')}")
                break
                
            await asyncio.sleep(2)

# Run the analysis
asyncio.run(analyze_driver("samples/RtDashPt.sys"))
```

### WebSocket Real-time Updates

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws/' + jobId);
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.event === 'completed') {
    console.log('Analysis completed!', data.result);
  }
};
```

### Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **The API currently has no authentication**. For production use, implement proper authentication and run behind a reverse proxy with TLS.

For complete API documentation, see [API_README.md](docs/API_README.md) or visit `/docs` when the API is running.

### Test Drivers

The `samples/` directory contains vulnerable test drivers:

- `test_physical_memory.sys` - MmMapIoSpace vulnerability
- `test_process_termination.sys` - ZwTerminateProcess vulnerability
- `test_use_after_free.sys` - UAF vulnerability
- `test_race_condition.sys` - Double-fetch vulnerability
- `test_file_operations.sys` - File operation vulnerabilities

### Dataset Benchmark

The `dataset/` directory contains 104 known vulnerable drivers for validation:

```bash
# Run full benchmark (takes 30-60 minutes)
./run_benchmark.sh

# Or run specific benchmark tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_dataset_benchmark.py -m benchmark

# Test a subset for quick validation
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_dataset_benchmark.py::TestDatasetBenchmark::test_performance_metrics
```

Benchmark generates:

- Detailed vulnerability analysis report
- Performance metrics (analysis time per driver)
- Detection rate statistics
- Vulnerability type distribution
